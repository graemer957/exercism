# Exercism

Repo storing my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/graemer957/solutions?track_slug=rust&order=newest_first).

## Strategy

My general strategy for completing exercises is thusly:
1. Take a look at `README.md` to understand the problem, and _attempt_ to build a mental model. I use the word attempt because sometimes it is just that!
2. Use a [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) approach to write just enough code for the first, unignored, test to pass.
3. Write the code in a way I believe is idiomatic, understandable and maintainable. Principally code is written for humans to understand.
4. Remove the `#[ignore]` from the next test
5. Rinse and repeat steps 2 through 4, until all tests pass
6. Review solution - apply small refactors now I understand the problem better and add comments.
7. Whilst I may have further ideas on how to improve or perform larger refactors, I now submit the solution.
8. Take a look at community solutions and apply what I learn to my thoughts on the next steps.
9. Produce zero, one or more iterations.

I do occasionally submit a solution for further mentoring, asking for specific feedback on a particular approach or improvement.
